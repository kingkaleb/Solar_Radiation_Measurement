**SOLAR DATA ANALYTICS** 

This repository contains the code, analysis, and documentation for a week-long challenge focused on analyzing solar farm data from Benin, Sierra Leone, and Togo. This challenge is a component of the evaluation for a 12-week training program in Data Engineering (DE), Financial Analytics (FA), and Machine Learning Engineering (MLE).

The project's objective is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on environmental data, derive actionable insights, and provide strategic recommendations for the best locations for solar farms. The project also includes the development of a Streamlit dashboard to visualize these insights.

The main components of this repository are:

-**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyzing data to uncover trends and patterns.

-**Statistical Analysis:** Utilizing statistical techniques to guide data-driven decisions.

-**Streamlit Dashboard:** Creating an interactive tool to present key insights.

-**CI/CD Implementation:** Establishing automated testing and deployment workflows.
